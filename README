Based on the "Digits Recognizer" Dojo here: https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Digits-Recognizer
 
Which in turn is based on the Kaggle challenge here:
http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

I've implemented this as a KNN classifier (where K=1) as a means 
of comparing multiple languages. 

Currently the implementations are in:

* F# (Parallel version)
* OCaml
  - classifyDigits.ml (non-parallelized version)
  - classifyDigitsPar.ml (uses Parmap to parallelize)

Also here:

* times.txt - uses 'time' to determine how long it takes to run 
  each version.
